## Paradigms of AI Programming Source Code

This project contains the Lisp source code for the book **"Paradigms of
Artificial Intelligence Programming"** by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com). The
code is offered as open source freeware under this [License](#License).  In
addition, code was divided into packages and additional comments was added.

#### Installation Instructions

- `git clone` the source code from the github repository.

- You must have a lisp compiler/interpreter.

- `quicklisp` should be configured

- To test all the code, start lisp in the project directory and do the
  following at the interactive prompt:

``` cl
(ql:quickload :study-paip)
(tutor:do-examples :all)
```

This should print out a long list of inputs and outputs, and the last
output should be the total number of errors. If all goes well, this should be *"0"*.

If you would like to run the examples for just a given chapter, you can do that
as well. For instance, once you have done `(ql:quickload :study-paip)`, this will
execute the examples for _Chapter 3_:

``` cl
(tutor:do-examples 3)
```

or

``` cl
(tutor:do-chapter 3 *standard-output*)
```

In some chapters there are many versions of the program. Examples to this attempts are
marked with a second digit. For example for _Chapter 4_ if you want to run first
naive approach:

``` cl
(tutor:do-examples 4.1)
```

**Final version** is only with one digit:

``` cl
(tutor:do-examples 4)
````

NOTE: If you want to see code without packages names (not fully qualified) you
have to go to the chapter first. For example _Chapter 4_:

``` cl
(in-package :ch4-final)
(tutor:do-examples 4)
```

#### Typical Study Session

_(to be added)_

#### Git Tags (work in progress)

Every chapter is a git tag(s):

```$ git checkout ch1```

will give you only files needed for chapter one.

### What Lessons are in PAIP?
_by Peter Norvig_

```
1. Use anonymous functions. [p. 20]
2. Create new functions (closures) at run time. [p. 22]
3. Use the most natural notation available to solve a problem. [p. 42]
4. Use the same data for several programs. [p. 43]
5. Be specific. Use abstractions. Be concise. Use the provided tools. Don't be
   obscure.  Be consistent. [p. 49]
6. Use macros (if really necessary). [p. 66]
7. There are 20 or 30 major data types; familiarize yourself with them. [p. 81]
8. Whenever you develop a complex data structure, develop a corresponding
   consistency checker. [p. 90]
9. To solve a problem, describe it, specify it in algorithmic terms, implement
   it, test it, debug and analyze it. Expect this to be an iterative
   process. [p. 110]
10. AI programming is largely exploratory programming; the aim is often to
    discover more about the problem area. [p. 119]
11. A general problem solver should be able to solve different
    problems. [p. 132]
12. We must resist the temptation to belive that all thinking follows the
    computational model. [p. 147]
13. The main object of this book is to cause the reader to say to him or herself
    "I could have written that". [p. 152]
14. If we left out the prompt, we could write a complete Lisp interpreter using
    just four symbols.  Consider what we would have to do to write a Lisp (or
    Java) interpreter in Java. [p. 176]
15. Design patterns can be used informally, or can be abstracted into a formal
    function, macro, or data type (often involving higher-order
    functions). [p. 177]
16. Use data-driven programming, where pattern/action pairs are stored in a
    table. [p. 182]
17. Sometimes "more is less": its easier to produce more output than just the
    right output. [p. 231]
18. Lisp is not inherently less efficient than other high-level languages -
    Richard Fateman. [p. 265]
19. First develop a working program. Second, instrument it. Third, replace the
    slow parts. [p. 265]
20. The expert Lisp programmer eventually develops a good "efficiency
    model". [p. 268]
21. There are four general techniques for speeding up an algorithm: caching,
    compiling, delaying computation, and indexing. [p. 269]
22. We can write a compiler as a set of macros. [p. 277]
23. Compilation and memoization can yield 100-fold speed-ups. [p. 307]
24. Low-level efficiency concerns can yield 40-fold speed-ups. [p. 315]
25. For efficiency, use declarations, avoid generic functions, avoid complex
    argument lists, avoid unnecessary consing, use the right data
    structure. [p. 316]
26. "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not
    worth knowing"
    - Alan Perlis. [p. 348]
27. Prolog relies on three important ideas: a uniform data base, logic
    variables, and automatic backtracking. [p. 349]
28. Prolog is similar to Lisp on the main points. [p. 381]
29. Object orientation = Objects + Classes + Inheritance - Peter Wegner [p. 435]
30. Instead of prohibiting global state (as functional programming does),
    object-oriented programming breaks up the unruly mass of global state and
    encapsulates it into small, manageable pieces, or objects. [p. 435]
31. Depending on your definition, CLOS is or is not object-oriented.  It doesn't
    support encapsulation. [p. 454]
32. Prolog may not provide exactly the logic you want [p. 465], nor the
    efficiency you want [p. 472].  Other representation schemes are possible.
33. Rule-based translation is a powerful idea, however sometimes you need more
    efficiency, and need to give up the simplicity of a rule-based system
    [p. 509].
34. Translating inputs to a canonical form is often a good strategy [p. 510].
35. An "Expert System" goes beyond a simple logic programming system: it
    provides reasoning with uncertainty, explanations, and flexible flow of
    control [p. 531].
36. Certainty factors provide a simple way of dealing with uncertainty, but
    there is general agreement that probabilities provide a more solid
    foundation [p. 534].
37. The strategy you use to search for a sequence of good moves can be important
    [p. 615].
38. You can compare two different strategies for a task by running repeated
    trials of the two [p. 626].
39. It pays to precycle [p. 633].
40. Memoization can turn an inefficient program into an efficient one [p. 662].
41. It is often easier to deal with preferences among competing interpretations
    of inputs, rather than trying to strictly rule one interpretation in or out
    [p 670].
42. Logic programs have a simple way to express grammars [p. 685].
43. Handling quantifiers in natural languiage can be tricky [p. 696].
44. Handling long-distance dependencies in natural language can be tricky
    [p. 702].
45. Understanding how a Scheme interpreter works can give you a better
    appreciation of how Lisp works, and thus make you a better programmer
    [p. 753].
46. The truly amazing, wonderful thing about call/cc is the ability to return to
    a continuation point more than once. [p. 771]
47. The first Lisp interpreter was a result of a programmer ignoring his boss's
    advice. [p. 777].
48. Abelson and Sussman (1985) is probably the best introduction to computer
    science ever written [p. 777].
49. The simplest compiler need not be much more complex than an interpreter
    [p. 784].
50. An extraordinary feature of ANSI Common Lisp is the facility for handling
    errors [p. 837].
51. If you can understand how to write and when to use once-only, then you truly
    understand macros [p. 853].
52. A word to the wise: don't get carried away with macros [p. 855].
```

#### Errata

Page *285*: Replace definition of `filter` function with:

``` cl
(defun filter (pred pipe)
  "keep only items in (non-null) pipe satisfying predicate"
  (if (eq pipe empty-pipe)
    empty-pipe
    (if (funcall pred (head pipe))
      (make-pipe (head pipe) (filter pred (tail pipe)))
      (filter pred (tail pipe)))))
```
