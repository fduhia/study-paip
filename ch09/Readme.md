#### Chapter 9

There are four very general and language-independent techniques for speeding
up an algorithm:

    * _Caching_ the results of computations for later reuse.
    * _Compiling_ so that less work is done at run time.
    * _Delaying_ the computation of partial results that may never be needed.
    * _Indexing_ a data structure for quicker retrieval.
